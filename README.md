# LDSSA Batch4 Capstone Project 
...under construction...

This repository is a compilation of notebooks used for analysis of the training data as well as the modelling process. It also includes a ready-to-deploy app built in flask and with the required endpoints acessible through a Heroku CLI. Futher more a streamlit web app was built with the purpose of facilitating the interaction with the data and the predictive model.
